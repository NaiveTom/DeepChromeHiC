	reStructuredText 
	================

This code will generate the title of this document, as you can see.

This title will automatically be added to the directory column on the left and the directory section of the welcome interface on the homepage.

Inserting a picture is one of the most important operations. The above is the method of inserting a picture.

The picture must be placed in the ``img`` folder first, otherwise an error will occur (you can set the file path yourself, but to avoid confusion, use the img folder.)

	In reStructuredText, a blank line is required between every two lines, otherwise there is no difference between writing on one line. There are some codes if there is no blank line, then an error will occur.
	
	In reStructuredText, a blank line has the same effect as a blank two or more lines, and both are blank lines.
